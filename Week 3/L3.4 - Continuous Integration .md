Continuous Integration (CI)
-
- TLDR: merging all changes from programmers into one place
  - we put tests into the repo so any code merged in has to pass the tests
- why/ in a nutshell: risk!
  - automates layers of quality checks (testing, type checking, linting) on code
  - ensures that master/main remains a safe source of truth
  - provides quality assurance
  - CI is run in a standardised environment
  - minimises risk by continuously integrating small changes, rather than making lots of changes at once
- minimising risk with CI
  - minimise risk by continuously integrating small changes, rather than making lots of changes at once
  - generally, the more lines changed, the greater the risk
    - more accurately: the more areas of the code that your change impacts, the greater the risk (e.g. CrowdStrike)
  - Nick's (Atlassian guest speaker) advice for merge requests / pull requests
  - keep them as small as possible - if in doubt, split it up
