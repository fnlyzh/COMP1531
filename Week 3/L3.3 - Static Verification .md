Risk & Software Safety
-
- concept:
  - protect threat to my software; often the biggest threat is myself (I'm the one who makes mistakes)
  - shift left: errors earlier > errors later
- types of errors:
  - `compile` errors: code failed to compile because missing `;` in code
  - `runtime` errors: code threw an exception because divided by 0
  - `logic` errors: code ran but gave wrong answer

Dynamic vs Static Verification
-
- concept:
  - dynamic: execute code to verify
  - static: don't have to execute code to verify
- dynamic:
  - Jest tests
  - manually running code and checking inputs/outputs
- static:
  - compiling C code (run GCC type checker)
  - SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing) - analyses code for vulnerabilities

Static Verification
-
- concept:
  - make code mathematically verifiable; into a mathematical model
- processes:
  - prove code by hand: code will be completely bug free
  - mix of manual/atuomated: e.g. seL4 (COMP9242) - a verified microkernel
- issue & solution:
  - proving code correctness formally via math models is very expensive!
  - solution: `proxy` to verify correctness since all code has `types`
  - `type checking`: verify types present in a program
  - if type checking:
    - passes: program may or may not be correct
    - fails: progress definitely incorrect
- type systems:
  - most programming languages have a type system
    - e.g. C, JS, TS, Java, Python
    - languages without type systems are Shell, Assembly, Visual Basic, and older languages
  - `statically typed` language:
    - type checking at compilation
    - programmer declares variable types
    - stronger & weaker type systems (only in statically typed):
      - depends on level of enforcement of types
      - C: statically typed with a weak type system (types must be declare and GCC run type checking)
  - `dynamically typed` language:
    - type checking at runtime
    - programmer doesn't annotate types

TypeScript
-
- concept:
  - like an older sister of JS, where types are declared
  - it's not an actual language, but an extension of JS
- process:
  - installation: 
    `npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node`
  - run command:
    `node_modules/.bin/ts-node <file name>.ts`
  - alternative, more strict run command (type check without running)
    `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noImplicitAny <file name>.ts`
- since TS is not an actual language, we need a TS interpreter
  - add `"tsc": "node_modules/.bin/tsc"` to `"scripts"` in `package.json`
  - when TS is run, it creates a JS version of the same file
  - i.e. we write in TS to make static verification of JS easier
