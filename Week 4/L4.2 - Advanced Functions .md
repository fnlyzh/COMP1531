Function Syntax
-
- let's begin with something simple
  - original code
    ```
    const sum = (a: number, b: number) => {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```
  - simplified code into one line for cleaner syntax; drop curly braces
    ```
    const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
    ```
- now, something more complex to see a greater impact
  - original code
    ```
    function manyString(repeat: number, str: string) {
      let outString = '';
      for (let i = 0; i < repeat; i++) {
          outString += str;
      }
      return outString;
    } 
    console.log(manyString(5, 'hello '));
    ```
  - simplified code
    ```
    const manyString(repeat: number, str: string) => {
      let outString = '';
      for (let i = 0; i < repeat; i++) {
          outString += str;
      }
      return outString;
    }
    console.log(manyString(5, 'hello '));
    ```

First Class Functions
-
- let's try a print function
  - original code
    ```
    const name = 'Hayden';
    console.log(name);
    ```
  - function definition
    ```
    const getName = () => {
      return 'Hayden';
    };
    console.log(getName);
    ```
- concept:
  - a language has first-class functions when functions are treated just like any other variable
  - most notably, functions can be passed into functions just like variables can
- let's try formating a string
  ```
  // this is a typescript thing
  type Fmtr = (str: string) => string;

  const brackets = (str: string) => `(${str})`;
  
  const fullstop = (str: string) => `${str}.`;

  // this simplified function is borderline getting too long
  // so it might be worth keeping the braces if it's any longer
  const sayHi = (name: string, format: Fmtr) => `Hello, ${format(name)}!`;
  
  const result = 
      sayHi('Hayden', brackets) +
      ' -- ' +
      sayHi('Hayden', fullstop);
  
  console.log(result);
  ```
- there are a lot more examples in the lecture slides; review them if I want to, but the general idea should be clear here
- first-class functions also allow for anonymous functions
  - function is only used once
  - therefore no point naming it
- summary
  - first-class functions predominantly used in terms of letting functions take in other functions as arguments
  - allows us to create more concise and clear code
  - particularly, enable use of anonymous functions for one-off usage
    - make code more compact for readability
  - also, is fundamental part of understanding callbacks

Map, Reduce, Filter
-
- concept
  - `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` are array functions that help us accomplish basic iterative tasks without overhead of a loop structure
  - based on ideas of first-class functions and anonymous functions
  - map: modify array
  - filter: select from array
  - reduce: summarise array
- map
  - take array of size N, produce new array of same size having modified each element according to a function passed in
  - code exmaple:
    ```
    const tutors = [
    'Simon',
    'Teresa',
    'Kaiqi',
    'Michelle',
    ];
    
    const shout = function(str: string) => `${str.toUpperCase()}!!!`;
    
    const newList = tutors.map(shout);
    console.log(newList);
    ```
- filter
  - take array of size N, produce new array of size 0..N without modifying any data
  - code example:
    ```
    const marks = [65, 72, 81, 40, 56];
    
    const newList = marks.filter((mark: number) => mark >= 50);
    console.log(newList);
    ```
- reduce
  - executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array resulting in a single output value
  - Hayden: reduce is not as commonly used as map and filter
  - code example:
    ```
    type Student = {
        name: string;
        mark: number;
    }
    
    const students: Student[] = [
        { name: 'Amy', mark: 55 },
        { name: 'Bob', mark: 43 },
        { name: 'Cap', mark: 34 },
        { name: 'Dex', mark: 23 },
    ];
    
    const sum = (prev: number, curr: Student) => prev + curr.mark;
    
    const single = students.reduce(sum, 0);
    console.log(single);
    ```
- combining all 3 functions!
  ```
  const marks = [39, 43.2, 48.6, 24, 33.6]; // marks out of 60
  console.log(marks);
  const normalisedMarks = marks.map(m => 100 * m / 60);
  console.log(normalisedMarks);
  const passingMarks = normalisedMarks.filter(m => m >= 50);
  console.log(passingMarks);
  const total = passingMarks.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  console.log(total);
  const average = total / passingMarks.length;
  console.log(average);
  ```

Higher Order Functions
-
- concept
  - functions that return functions
  - think of them like mini function factorise
  - 

Callbacks
