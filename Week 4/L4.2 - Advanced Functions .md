Function Syntax
-
- let's begin with something simple
  - original code
    ```
    const sum = (a: number, b: number) => {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```
  - simplified code into one line for cleaner syntax; drop curly braces
    ```
    const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
    ```
- now, something more complex to see a greater impact
  - original code
    ```
    function manyString(repeat: number, str: string) {
      let outString = '';
      for (let i = 0; i < repeat; i++) {
          outString += str;
      }
      return outString;
    } 
    console.log(manyString(5, 'hello '));
    ```
  - simplified code
    ```
    const manyString(repeat: number, str: string) => {
      let outString = '';
      for (let i = 0; i < repeat; i++) {
          outString += str;
      }
      return outString;
    }
    console.log(manyString(5, 'hello '));
    ```

First Class Functions
-
- let's try a print function
  - original code
    ```
    const name = 'Hayden';
    console.log(name);
    ```
  - function definition
    ```
    const getName = () => {
      return 'Hayden';
    };
    console.log(getName);
    ```
- concept:
  - a language has first-class functions when functions are treated just like any other variable
  - most notably, functions can be passed into functions just like variables can
- let's try formating a string
  ```
  // this is a typescript thing
  type Fmtr = (str: string) => string;

  const brackets = (str: string) => `(${str})`;
  
  const fullstop = (str: string) => `${str}.`;

  // this simplified function is borderline getting too long
  // so it might be worth keeping the braces if it's any longer
  const sayHi = (name: string, format: Fmtr) => `Hello, ${format(name)}!`;
  
  const result = 
      sayHi('Hayden', brackets) +
      ' -- ' +
      sayHi('Hayden', fullstop);
  
  console.log(result);
  ```
- there are a lot more examples in the lecture slides; review them if I want to, but the general idea should be clear here
- first-class functions also allow for anonymous functions
  - function is only used once
  - therefore no point naming it
- summary
  - first-class functions predominantly used in terms of letting functions take in other functions as arguments
  - allows us to create more concise and clear code
  - particularly, enable use of anonymous functions for one-off usage
    - make code more compact for readability
  - also, is fundamental part of understanding callbacks
