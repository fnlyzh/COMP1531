Needs that Git solves:
-
- version control: tracks changes to our code over time systematically (like a log book)
- concurrent programming: many people can work on same files

Importance of git add:
-
- we can separate completed files from incomplete files for a commit
- we can separate completed files from each other for more concisely documented, separated commits
- `git reset <file>` to unadd a file, or just `git reset` to unadd all files

Conflicts
-
- I can't `push` if a remote change occurred after I cloned/pulled
- to solve this, I must `pull` the most recent version, resolve the conflict in my local code, and then push again
