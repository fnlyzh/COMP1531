Needs that Git solves:
-
- version control: tracks changes to our code over time systematically (like a log book)
- concurrent programming: many people can work on same files

Git - Importance of git add:
- we can separate completed files from incomplete files for a commit
- we can separate completed files from each other for more concisely documented, separated commits
- `git reset <file>` to unadd a file, or just `git reset` to unadd all files
