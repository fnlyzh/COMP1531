Why Javascript
-
- popularity & demand
- used for front-end & back-end development
- rapid prototyping; rich open-source library & package manager; very high level

Javascript vs C - Main Hurdles
-
- no programmer-defined types
- no pointers
- no intermediate compilation step
- has objected-oriented components
- written at a higher level (more abstract)

NodeJS
-
NodeJS is the program that compiles and runs Javascript (oversimplified as the GCC of Javascript).  
  
NodeJS is an `interpreted` language instead of a `compiled` language.  
This has 2 implications:
- slower to run; has to compile to runnable code every time
- more convenient; changes to code don't require an extra compilation step

Variables & Printing
-
`let` declares variables that can be modified after definition
```
let years = 5;
let name = "Cheese";
```
`const` declares variables that cannot be modified after definition
```
const height = 10.11;
const fullname = "Giraffe";
```
`console.log` does print
```
console.log(fullname)'
console.log("Hello!");
```
Note: `"` and `'` are equivalent

Strings
-
Concatenation
```
let sentence = 'My';
sentence = sentence + ' name is';
sentence += ' Pikachu';

console.log(sentence);
```
Interpolation (use literals to mix variables & expressions into strings)
```
const age = 7;
const fullname = 'Yuchao';
const phrase = `Hello! My name is ${fullname} and I am ${age}`;

console.log(phrase);
```

Control Structures
-
The `if`, `else if`, `else`, `while`, and `for` are the same as C
```
const number = 5;
if (number > 10) {
  console.log('Bigger than 10');
} else if (number < 2) {
  // Do nothing
} else {
  console.log('Number between 2 and 9');
}

console.log('--------------------------');

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log('Hello there');
  i += 1;
}

console.log('--------------------------');

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log('Hello there');
}
```
Note: for the `for` loop, we changed `int i` to `let i`. 

Functions
-
Very similar to C; uses `function` instead of the return type.
```
function minimum(a, b) {
  if (a > b) {
    return b;
  } else {
    return a;
  }
}
```

Data Structures: Collections
-
Collections of data are either:
- sequential collections
- associative collections

Sequential Collections
- values referenced by their integer index (key) that represents their location in an order
- represented by an `array` in Javascript

Associative Collections
- values referenced by their string key that maps to a value; no inherit sense of order
- similar to a `struct` in C

Arrays
-
- dynamic
- hold different data types
Example
```
const names = ['Hayden', 1, 'Darcy','Giuliana'];

console.log(`1 ${names}`);     // 1 Hayden,1,Darcy,Giuliana
console.log(`2 ${names[0]}`);  // 2 Hayden
names[1] = 'Yuchao';
names.push('Rani');
console.log(`3 ${names}`);     // 3 Hayden,Yuchao,Darcy,Giuliana,Rani

console.log(names.length);     // 5
```
Note: Javascript has `methods` and .push() is an array method.  
  
Iteration
```
const items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(items[i]);
  i++;
}

for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
 console.log(items[j]);
}

for (let k = 0; k < items.length; k++) {
 console.log(items[k]);
}
```
Thoughts: I think the third way is my favourite!  

For In Loop vs For Of Loop
```
const items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

// prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
for (const i in items) {
  console.log(items[i]);
}

// prints a, b, c, d, e
for (const item of items) {
  console.log(item);
}

// prints true
console.log(items.includes('c'));
```
Note:
- For In statement loops through array properties
- For Out statement loops through array values
