Why Javascript
-
- popularity & demand
- used for front-end & back-end development
- rapid prototyping; rich open-source library & package manager; very high level

Javascript vs C - Main Hurdles
-
- no programmer-defined types
- no pointers
- no intermediate compilation step
- has objected-oriented components
- written at a higher level (more abstract)

NodeJS
-
NodeJS is the program that compiles and runs Javascript (oversimplified as the GCC of Javascript).  
  
NodeJS is an `interpreted` language instead of a `compiled` language.  
This has 2 implications:
- slower to run; has to compile to runnable code every time
- more convenient; changes to code don't require an extra compilation step

Variables & Printing
-
`let` declares variables that can be modified after definition
```
let years = 5;
let name = "Cheese";
```
`const` declares variables that cannot be modified after definition
```
const height = 10.11;
const fullname = "Giraffe";
```
`console.log` does print
```
console.log(fullname)'
console.log("Hello!");
```
Note: `"` and `'` are equivalent
