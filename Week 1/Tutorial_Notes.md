Attend every tutorial; if not, my group project mark gets scaled down

Javascript - Misc:
-
- I don't need ; in JS
- no main function ; run from top to bottom
- const for everything unless you know you want to change it
- no type in function params; name suffices
- back ticks ` replace " to create string literal
- triple `===` should be used instead of `==` for exact equal
  - if we used `==`, then `"2" == 2` would be true
  - whereas `"2" === 2` would be false

Javascript - Objects:
- 
- I can delete objects or a property of an object using `delete`
