Branching Purpose:
-
- allows us to test changes on a copy of the main version to see if it works before we publish the feature

Branching Commands:
-
- `git branch` shows the branches in the project
- `git checkout -b <new branch name>` creates and changes us to a new branch
- `git checkout <branch name>` changes us to an existing different branch
- `git merge master` merges my current branch 
- `git log` shows the change history
- in `git status`, you can also check which branch you current are on

Upstream Branch Issue:
-
- we can commit as much as we want onto the non-main branch
- however we can't `push`, because the remote repo doesn't know we are working on a non-main branch, and thinks we are pushing onto the main branch
- resolve with `git push origin <branch name>` to push onto that branch instead of the main branch
- similarly, we can `git pull origin <branch name>` to pull from a specific branch instead of the main branch

Non-main Branch:
-
- to push, we must create a `merge request` which is asking to put the changes on the non-main branch into the main branch
- after I make the merge request, I want another team member to review it
