Iteration 1 Feedback
-
- git commit messages: change + reason
- no need to test for single + multipe
  - just do singular
  - if testing for list functions, 2 is optimal
- try to not use `for` loops
  - use Javascript methods
- make use of helper functions for repeated code
  - reduce repeated logic; e.g. valid ID checks
- tests should not know what the error message is exactly; just do expect error

Iteration 2 Overview
