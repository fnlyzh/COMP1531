Lecture Objectives
-
Why?
- to utilise javascript fully, we can install other modules that aren't on our system
- manage installations on multi-user projects  
What?
- problems with packages
- NPM and how it works
- manage packages
- custom scripts

NPM
-
- `npm init` to initialise npm in a project
  - this creates a `package.json` file in the project
  - sometimes, we need to put `"type:" module` in the outermost `{}` of `package.json` file for modules to work
- we can find all sorts of packages on `npmjs.com`
  - there's a search bar for searching for relevant packages
  - each package has more information on the right side of their page
  - number of weekly downloads is something I can look at to determine reliability of the author
- `npm i <package name>` to install a package
  - if it's the first package installed in the project, it'll also create a `node_modules` folder containing all package
  - within the package folder, it contains files for all functions in the package
- `package-lock.json` file contains a lot of information:
  - where I installed the packages, their versions, etc (in `dependencies`)
  - we must ensure everyone in the project is on the same version of the packages
- to use a package, the `README` section of the packages should tell me the instructions
  - instructions are usually some lines of code to import the package; I paste it into my file
- in `package.json`, there's a part called `scripts`
  - I can change the `test` to a different test name, and add files behind `echo \"<test name>: "` (ref: W2 L2 `1:10:40` ish)
  - this allows me to run tests from calling `npm run <test name>`
  - I can also add more items to `scripts` in new lines after `"<test name>",`

Git & NPM:
- when we commit and push, we do not want to push all our packages into the master branch
  - this is because we could have hundreds of packages, meaning it'll take a long time to push and pull for everyone
  - solution is to add a `.gitignore` file (outermost project folder) and write `node_modules/` inside it
- then, how will my teammates have the npm packages for the code to work?
  - `npm install` is what they should run after pulling
  - this command looks through the files imported and automatically installs the packages!
