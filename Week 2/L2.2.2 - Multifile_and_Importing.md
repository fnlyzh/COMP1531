Lecture Objectives
-
Why?
- most software projects involve working across multiple files that need to interact
What?
- importing libraries
- importing our own files

Multi-File Functions
-
- we want to keep the "main" file workflow much neater; easier to read and maintain
  - achieved by having implementations of functions in a separate file to the "main" code 
- if we want to use one function from one file in another file
  - put `export default <function name>` at end of source file
  - put `import <function name> from "<source file name>"` at start of function-use file
  - if we export/import only 1 function, we can change the name of the function when we import and it'll still work!
- if we want to export/import multiple functions
  - put `export { <function name 1>, <function name 2>, ... }` at end of source file
  - put `import { <function name 1>, <function name 2>, ... } from "<source file name>"` at start of function-use file
  - if we want to change the function name in we import, we'll have to do `<function name> as <customised function name>`
- although we can change names of functions, it's not recommended since it becomes confusing as our code gets longer and import more functions
