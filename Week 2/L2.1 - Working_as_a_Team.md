When Assigning a Task
-
- always set a deadline
- avoid the social diffusion effect; don't assign a task for multiple people - be distinct
- exploit commitment bias; get the member to write down what they will specifically do and sign their name there
- social facilitation effect; be in a proper working environment
- check in regularly and send reminders
- a team will not lead itself

Be a Better Contributor
-
- 80/20 rule: put effort in where it makes the most impact
- embrance imposter syndrome: always give things a go even if it might be challenging
- be transparent; if things aren't going well, tell the group

Improve Technical Skills
-
- break problems down into smaller pieces
- understand how concepts fit together; track flow of program from start to end, each line it executes
- try it yourself and then ask for help: don't stay stuck for too long
- read other people's code; be proactive in learning from others
- practice makes better, perfect is an illusion; done > perfect, something > nothing
